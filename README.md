Steps to reproduce:

1. build the project using maven `mvn package`, this will produce 
   a file `target/ümlaut_demö.jar`
2. run the demo (`demo.cmd` or `demo.sh`)

I tested with JDK 21 (latest temurin) on Windows 11.

The original problem I had was, that Intellij shortens command line
by using an argfile. As my name contains an Umlaut (Gerald Mücke), and so
does my microsoft account, my windows profile path is C:\Users\GeraldMücke
and all the classpath entries in the argfile generated by IntellJ
contain this path, rendering the argile option totally unusable.
